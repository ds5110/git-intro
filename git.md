Some notes about using git from the command-line.

## Install git

You may have it already! So don't be in a rush to install it. Section 1.5 in the online book has guidance on installing command-line git. Chapter 1 is worth reading if you want background.

* If you have conda, then it's as easy as...
```
conda install -c conda-forge git
```

## Tutorials

These tutorials describe advanced usage of git and github, which you may use later in the course.

* [github starter course](https://github.com/education/github-starter-course)
* [atlassian git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git) -- atlassian.com
  * Some very good tutorials
  * [Begginner guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
  * [Setting up a repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository) -- pretty good
  * [Collaborating](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing) -- later in the course
* [github cli](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli) -- github.com
  * This -- the github CLI -- is NOT the same as "git" (I don't use it)

## Cloning

* [Clone a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

## Committing

After you make a change to your local repository, commit the changes and add a message:

```
$ git commit . -m "I made a small but super-important change to such and such."
```
To check the status of current repo
```
$ git status
```
To review the commit history
```
$ git log 
```
To checkout a previous commit
```
$ get checkout <tag/branch/commit id>
```
To reset to a previous commit (because you'll lose everything since then!)
```
$ get reset --hard <tag/branch/commit id>
```
WARNING: Be super careful about using `git reset --hard` because it's destructive. Measure twice, cut once!!

## Branches

Branches allow you to develop outside the main branch.  This is good for experimenting and collaborating.

* `$ git branch`
  * list branches, including current branch
  * default branch is usually "main"
  * if you haven't created any branches, that'll be the only one
* `$ git branch demo`
  * create the "demo" branch
* `$ git checkout demo`
  * switch to the demo branch
* You need to specify the upstream for the branch before you can "push" or "pull"
* We're not going to be using the workflow for branches, at least not now.
* To merge a branch
  ```
  $ git commit . -m "I made a such-and-such a change"
  $ git checkout main
  $ git merge demo
  ```
* To delete a branch after merging
  * `$ git branch -d branch`
* To delete a branch without merging
  * `$ git branch -D branch`

## Update a repository

You update the repository by "pushing to origin". This is okay if you're the only one working on the project.

```
$ git push origin main
```
If you've made a change, then you need first to commit
```
$ git commit . -m "I've made a such-and-such a change"  
$ git push origin main
```

## Pull requests

## Removing a file/directory from git history

`git filter-repo` usage -- if you commit sensitive data (e.g. password) or you accidentally commit a huge file. Be careful how you deal with this.  The article on github.com is a good one...
